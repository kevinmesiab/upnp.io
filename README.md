# upnp.fiddler

Node application that allows you to interact with Universal Plug and Play devices.  



## Universal Plug and Play
 

The main goal of UPnP is to make adding network devices and networked programs to a network as easy as it is to plug in a piece of hardware into a PC (or even easier, as that is often error prone). The devices and programs find out about the network setup and other networked devices and programs through discovery and advertisements of services and configure themselves accordingly. In short: UPnP is a framework to build networked applications.


Depending on the context 'UPnP' can mean completey different things. For a router this often means that the Internet Gateway Device Profile is implemented. For a media device it means that MediaServer, MediaRenderer or RemoteUI is implemented.
